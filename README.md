Sudoku Game

Hi everyone, this is a Java program for solving a 4/4 Sudoku game with numbers ranging from 1 to 4
which was a built for an assignment belonging to a friend of mine.
I hope this puzzle will help and inspire many geeks out there.
So if anyone gets any flaws in the program or wants to optimize the space-time trade off, feel free to pull the code and suggest/provide a 
better solution to this.

Thank you all,
Happy Coding !!
